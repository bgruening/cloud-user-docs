# Project Termination

If you want to terminate your project in the de.NBI Cloud, you can initiate this via the portal.

## Termination Process

The basic management of a project is possible on the [project overview](project_overview.md) page of each project.
There you can submit a termination request, by clicking on "Request termination"
